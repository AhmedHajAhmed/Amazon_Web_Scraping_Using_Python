# Amazon_Web_Scraping_Using_Python

In this project, I will scrape tha Amazon page for a [mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Air75-Mechanical-Connection-Compatible-Systems-Gateron/dp/B09KFRZS3J/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=mechanical+keyboard&qid=1654900125&sprefix=mechan%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-13) and extract the title, price, and ratings. Additionally, I will build a function to automate the process of checking the price of the product everyday and appending the details into a .CSV file.
